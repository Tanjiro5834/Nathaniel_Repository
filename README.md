# Nathaniel_Repository

Welcome to the My repository
I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student at STI College and I'm on my way to my dream of becoming a software engineer in the future, this repository highlights some of the projects I built with different programming languages. I upload projects every day consistently mainly in Java and C++, but I also upload codes using other languages including php, js, python, c etc.
